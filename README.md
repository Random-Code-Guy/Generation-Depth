**Project Started 13/07/2024**

This project started out as a hobby to try generating depth maps using ZeoDepth but
then expanded to trying to use tiling to increese the depth map quality

This application has a very simple gui using tkinter with generation done in its own
thread to keep it stable

Model is auto downloaded from torch hub if not local cache is found

This is a work in progress please feel free to submit code to this project i will test and add everything that
passes tests and improves the application
