<h2>Generation Depth -Tiling Depth Map Generator</h2>

[**Random-Code-Guy**]<sup>1</sup>

**Project Started 13/07/2024**

This project started out as a hobby to try generating depth maps using ZeoDepth but
then expanded to trying to use tiling to increese the depth map quality

This application has a very simple gui using tkinter with generation done in its own
thread to keep it stable

This application will be updated in the future to support a number of models including 
MiDaS, ZoeDepth, DepthAnythingV2 and all of there options where possible!

This is a work in progress please feel free to submit code to this project i will test and add everything that
passes tests and improves the application
